            <p>
              It all started with a swipe. <br />
              In March of 2022, we matched on Hinge. Just another swipe, or so it
              seemed. Neither of us could’ve known that moment would quietly change
              the rest of our lives.

            <p>
              Our first date was at Local Lime in April of 2022. The moment I saw you,
              I felt something different. Something real. It ended with an awkward kiss in your car,
              and from then on I couldn’t stop thinking about you.

            <p>
              By the end of that month, I asked you to be my girlfriend. It felt
              natural, like a decision I didn’t have to think twice about. That was
              the best decision of my life.

            <p>
              In September of 2022, we moved into our first apartment together.
              It was a little rough at first, we had to threaten legal action at Eagle Rock. 
              But we made it our own.
              A few weeks later, we brought home Cheddar, our tiny orange son who
              quickly took over everything. It wasn’t just a place to live anymore.
              It was home.

            <p>
              On May 10th, 2022, you graduated with your Associate of Science degree.
              Watching you finish school gave me the courage to go back and finish
              mine. In January of 2024, I returned to school, because you showed me
              I could. And then, together, we encouraged you to chase your next goal:
              accounting.

            <p>
              Throughout our time together, you've changed me for the better.
              You helped me quit my unhealthy habits and supported me through it all.
              You didn't just support me, you saved me.

            <p>
              In August of 2024, while going back to school, you landed your job
              at Colliers. After eight years of serving at Cheers,
              you stepped into something new, something you worked hard for. In May
              of 2025, you earned your second associate degree in Business. Watching
              you grow has been one of the greatest privileges of my life.

              On New Year’s Day 2024, we upgraded to a rent house. And in July of
              2025, we bought our first home together. A place built on years of
              teamwork, patience, and belief in each other.

              I will always choose you.
